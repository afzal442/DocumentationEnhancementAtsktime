## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting the *Documentation Enhancement with open science practices* project repository. Find out more about the project below.

## :seedling: What are we doing?

**Vision statement:**
To make it easier for users and developers of sktime to recognize their contributions more visibly and formally to encourage long-term maintenance of their contributions

### The problem
There is a lack of an estimator overview in sktime linking code (classes or functions), with their docstring, the contributor and literature. This makes it hard for users when they have a question to ask about any particular code or an algorithm.

### The solution
To solve the problem, we need to implement an automated learning algorithm. 

## :ear_of_rice: Who are we?

Project lead: [Afzal Ansari](https://github.com/afzal442) and Abdulelah Al Mesfer

## Acknowledgments

This project is developed as part of the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) program, with mentorship from [Toby Hodges](https://github.com/tobyhodges).

README was inspired by [STEMM Role Models App](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/gh-pages/README.md).


## Install

These instructions are basic; you can use any method to do this work. The important part is making sure that you follow the checklist below before publishing the repository.

```sh
# Let's make a new folder
mkdir new-repo && cd new-repo
# Start a Git instance and copy over template files.
git init
cp ../repo-template/* .
# Overwrite this README
mv README.md setup-checklist.md
mv example-README.md README.md
# Go over and check off the checklist, and finally
rm setup-checklist
```

### Dotfiles
- [ ] Do you need a `.gitignore` file?
- [ ] Do you need an `.npmignore` file?

### License
- [ ] Copy the MIT license from the example repo.
- [ ] Is `Haja Networks Oy` the licensor?

- [ ] If you made changes, were these reflected in the last section of the README?

### GitHub Metadata
- [ ] Have you added a short description to the repository?
  - [ ] Is the description matched in the byline under the title in the README?

- [ ] ...for the browser as well?
- [ ] Are those reflected in CI?
- [ ] Bonus points: Using CircleCI workflows to segment tests?
- [ ] Extra bonus points: Are you cross-testing dependencies (i.e. are changes in `orbit-db-keystore` tested in `orbit-db` as well
